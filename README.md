# Motivation

To master a subject you need to do _deliberate practice_.
Anki's implementation of [spaced repetition](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition) and [active recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect) creates a great env for _deliberate practice_.
The goal therefore is to create the best resource for mastering software design.
